# 370-Final-Proj

http://learnwebgl.brown37.net/rendering/render_example_02.html

This website may be helpful in figuring out the issue with making sides unique colors. Basically it designs each triangle seperate
to each other, then renders the triangles seperately. This would take quite a bit of rework to our project ATM. 

If we can get the colors right, I think that will be a fine standpoint for our progress presentation, and actually rotating the cube and
adding custom images can wait til the final due date.
